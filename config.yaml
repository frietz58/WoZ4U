    - Thats a really good question, but I dont know the answer to this right now.

    - Oh too bad! Lets try something else! Give me a moment.
    - Now lets start painting!
    - Here is the reference image.
    - Draw the basic shape of the object, but don't worry about the realism here. It's okay to take some liberties.
    - Are you done with making the outline?
    - Don't worry, you can do it. I trust you. I can help you more if you want.
    - Nice work! Let's go to the next step.
    - Once you are happy with the basic sketch, you can start filling in and refining your drawing. Look at the reference image shown on the tablet and add the shades and highlight.
    - Are you done with adding tones?

    - Nice work! Let's go to the next step.

    - Are you done making the outline?
    - Don't worry! Take a closer look at the reference image, I'll wait for you!
    - Good job! Let's go to the next step.
    - Now that you have an outline, you can add details to your painting. Start with things that are farther away and then progress to the items that look closer.
    - Are you done with adding the details?
    - Keep going, you are doing great! Take a closer look at the picture!
    - Do you want to refine your painting more or do you want to end the painting session?
    - I am so proud of you, this looks so beautiful. Now let me take a picture of this so I can share this with your loved one!
    - You can see the painting in the tablet and maybe add more details. Whatever feels right.
